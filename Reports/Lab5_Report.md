## Procedures

**Introduction.** The goal of this lab is to design, implement, and test a Stopwatch. constraints for this lab is to utilize the 50MHz internal clock and have the stopwatch track within a 100th of a second. we also cannot use a clock divider.

The procedures for this lab are as follows

1. Create a Quartus project using the System Builder application
2. Create an initial implementation of the stopwatch
3. Create a testbench to test the ten-bit counter & verify correct behavior
4. Compile and load the counter onto the FPGA for visual confirmation

**Issues and Errors.** 

**Stumbles.** 

## Results

## Conclusion
This lab has demonstrated our understanding of separate arithmetic logic from clock logic within the FPGA. In addition, this lab as provided more insight into gaps of our knowledge.
