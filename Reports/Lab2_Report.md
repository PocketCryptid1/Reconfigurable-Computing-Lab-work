## Procedures

### Introduction

The goal of this lab is to design, implement, and test a Stopwatch. constraints for this lab is to utilize the 50MHz internal clock and have the stopwatch track within a 100th of a second. we also cannot use a clock divider.

The procedures for this lab are as follows\

1. Create a Quartus project using the System Builder application

2. Create an initial implementation of the stopwatch

3. Create a testbench to test the ten-bit counter & verify correct behavior

4. Compile and load the counter onto the FPGA for visual confirmation
